# Image-Caption-Generator


The objective of this project is to systematically analyse a deep neural network based on
image caption generation. Image caption generator is a fundamental task that involves
computer vision and natural language processing concepts to recognize the context of an
image and describe them in a natural language like English.
In this Python project, we will be implementing the caption generator using CNN
(Convolutional Neural Networks) and LSTM (Long short term memory). The
image features will be extracted from Xception which is a CNN model trained on
the image dataset and then we feed the features into the LSTM model which
will be responsible for generating the image captions.
